In this module we look at images and videos as 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) signals, and discuss their analog/digital dichotomy. We will also see how the characteristics of an image changes depending on its placement over the electromagnetic spectrum, and how this knowledge can be leveraged in several applications.
